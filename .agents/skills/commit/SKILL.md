# Git Commit with Conventional Commits

## Instructions

1. Run `git status` to see all staged, unstaged, and untracked files. If there are no changes at all, inform the user and stop.
2. Run `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to read the actual content of every change (including already-staged changes).
3. Run `git log --oneline -5` to understand the recent commit style of the repository.
4. Group the changed files into logically separate, meaningful units (e.g. by feature, module, or purpose). Do not lump unrelated changes into a single commit, and do not split a single coherent change across multiple commits.
5. For each group, in order:
   - Stage only the files belonging to that group with `git add <specific paths>` (never `git add -A` or `git add .`, to avoid accidentally including unrelated or sensitive files).
   - Before committing, check the files staged in this group aren't sensitive (e.g. `.env`, credentials) — warn the user and skip that file if so.
   - Generate a commit message for that group following the rules below.
   - Execute `git commit` with the generated message.
6. After all groups are committed, run `git log --oneline -N` (N = number of commits created) and `git status` to confirm everything was committed successfully.

## Commit Message Rules

### Format (Conventional Commits)

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]
```

### Types

- `feat`: a new feature
- `fix`: a bug fix
- `docs`: documentation only changes
- `style`: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: a code change that improves performance
- `test`: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Rules

- Write commit messages in **English**
- The `description` must start with a **lowercase** letter
- The `description` must **not** end with a period
- The `description` describes **what was done** (concise, imperative mood)
- The `body` describes **why it was done** (include whenever possible)
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Users needed a way to sign in with third-party providers without
creating a new account, improving onboarding experience.
```

```
fix: resolve null pointer exception on empty input

The previous implementation did not handle the case where the input
was empty, causing crashes in production.
```

## Execution

For each group, stage its files explicitly, then pass each commit-message
paragraph directly with a separate `-m` option:

```bash
git add <path1> <path2> ...
git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>" -m "<optional body>"
```

Do not use shell substitution such as `$(...)`, a heredoc, or a here-string when
running `git commit`. For a subject-only message, use one `-m`; for a message
with multiple paragraphs, use one `-m` per paragraph. This keeps the invocation
compatible with the repository's permission rule for `git commit -m`.

Repeat for every group. After the last commit, show the result of `git log --oneline -N` (N = number of commits created) to confirm all commits were created successfully.
